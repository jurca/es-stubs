# ECMAScript stubs

This repository contains stubs of the APIs defined in various ECMAScript
versions, that have been annotated with Closure compiler-compatible type
annotations and documentation extracted from the MDN.

The repository also contains the tool that has been used to extract the
documentation from the MDN and include it into the stubs.

These stubs are meant to be used in code editors that do support displaying
documentation of APIs, but lack a good documentation of the native ECMAScript
APIs (e.g. WebStorm 2016).
